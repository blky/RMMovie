# RottenTomatoes Box Office Demo

This is an IOS Swift demo application for displaying the movies list by using [RottenTomatoes API](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/).  

Time spent: 18 hours spent in total 

 * first version I did basic function within around 7 hours.  
 * second version I did with delegate, swift class for data model, as well as adding more optional features around 10 hour. 

Completed user stories:
------------------------

* User can view a list of movies from Rotten Tomatoes. Poster images must be loading asynchronously.
* User can view movie details by tapping on a cell
* User sees loading state while waiting for movies API. You can use one of the 3rd party libraries at cocoacontrols.com.
* User sees error message when there's a networking error. You may not use UIAlertView to display the error. See this screenshot for what the error message should look like: network error screenshot.
* User can pull to refresh the movie list.
* All images fade in (optional)
* For the large poster, load the low-res image first, switch to high-res when complete (optional)
* Add a tab bar for Box Office and DVD. (optional)
* Add a search bar. (optional)


Stories not implemented:
--------------------------
* All images should be cached in memory and disk. In other words, images load immediately upon cold start (optional).
* Customize the highlight and selection effect of the cell. (optional)
* Customize the navigation bar. (optional)
